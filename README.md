WHAT?
-----

This is my recreation of Tumblr, using MeteorJS, NPM, and all that cool stuff that people are talking about these days.

WHY?
----

I spend far too much time on Tumblr not doing work. I might as well copy it and see how hard it actually is. Since I need things to show employers that I am worth my weight, a fully functional open-source blogging platform/micro-social network seems like a good place

WHO?
----

I'm not a god at programming. I am just a kid who likes to tinker and solve problems without worrying about how to use the solutions I find. You can find me on the socials under _cirsca_, on the  [facebooks](http://facebook.com/cirsca) and the [tweets](http://www.twitter.com/cirsca). When you find errors, create a new issue!
